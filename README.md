# PythonUtilities
A set of simple utility APIs for higher-level python functions, 
PythonUtilities exposes a library of modules that simplify common python programming tasks.

## Structure
PythonUtilities is divided into several different modules for organization.
Those modules are as follows:
- config_util: Provides a wrapper around ConfigurationParser that behaves like a dictionary, and supports section verification and default sections/values.
- list_util: Provides convenience functions for dealing with lists.
- log_util: Provides convenience functions for working with the builtin logging module, and extending it's functionality with colored console logging, and more.
- pyqt_util: Provides convenience functions for common pyqt operations.
- reflection_util: Provides convenience functions for common python reflection operations and dynamic object lookups.
- string_util: Provides convenience functions for manipulating and working with python strings.
- thread_util: Provides convenience wrappers for pyqt QThread and QThreadPool.
- unit_conversion: Provides convenience functions to convert to and from different integer units.
